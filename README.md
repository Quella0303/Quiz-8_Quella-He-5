## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

### Inspiration: *Blade Runner 2049* â€“ Holographic Interface

In *Blade Runner 2049*, the film showcases a futuristic user interface featuring transparent, layered holograms that respond to user interactions with fluid animations and soft light glows. This style inspires my project as it balances clarity with a futuristic aesthetic, aligning with the immersive digital interface I aim to create. Incorporating responsive layers and soft-focus glows can enhance user engagement, providing a visually appealing hierarchy of information suitable for our assignment's interactive requirements.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

### Technique: `blendMode(ADD)` in p5.js for Glowing Effects

To replicate the glowing, layered visuals inspired by *Blade Runner 2049*, I plan to use the `blendMode(ADD)` function in p5.js. This technique blends overlapping colors to simulate light emission and transparency. By combining semi-transparent shapes with smooth motion, it can recreate the holographic and layered feel. This approach is ideal for highlighting important UI elements or transitions in my project's interface.
